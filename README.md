# ➡️ "Deliver value daily" ⬅️

A one-principle manifesto for agile software development

## Why?

By delivering value daily:

- ✅ You will maintain an understanding of what _value_ means for your users<br>
- ✅ You will put things into place to _deliver_ that value<br>
- ✅ You will receive _daily_ feedback validating your assumptions

And of course:

- 🏆 You will deliver value daily

## How?

- 🔬 Extract smaller goals

The single most important technique is to choose something _smaller_ than what is assumed to be needed, and do whatever it takes to get that useable by some real users by the end of the day. Often it will be _much_ smaller, and ideally something that would even take much less than a day so you limit the risk of not completing it within the day, and you increase the chance of delivering value multiple times in the day.

To make this choice, you often need to be close to users - for example in direct contact with them. It also requires a certain level of confidence - do what it takes to develop this if you think you're low.

## But... what about [https://agilemanifesto.org/](https://agilemanifesto.org/)?

- 🎯 Aiming for daily value will result following the 12 principles

Following this one principle will result in adhering to many of the 12 principles of the original Agile Manifesto - especially the principles that are important in your case.

## But... what about investing for the future?

- ⚖️ Balance value today with investing for tomorrow

You can do other tasks that don't result in value today, but just not whole days at a time - at least _some_ time of each day your should deliver value by the end of the day. By following the principle you will balance delivering value today with investing for more value tomorrow.

Do not refactor or address "tech debt" without a clear idea of how it will lead to value, and merge and release such investment changes daily, just as you would any other. And of course, if something repeatedly doesn't lead to value, you should consider not doing it.

## But... does this risk reducing quality?

- 🎩 Maintain quality by changing less

No! This is not about cutting corners, this is about choosing the _smallest_ pieces of work that you can complete each day at the quality level you decide is appropriate in order to provide value.

## But... I won't be able to keep up by delivering every day

- 🐌 Maintain velocity by aiming to do less

Do not set out to complete features as asked for each day - this is impossible. Instead, set out to complete small parts of them, and don't be afraid of shrinking things even further as each day progresses.

## But... we work in sprints and I can't change that?

- 🫵🏻 Do what you can to get close to value

Do what you can to split out the smallest _valuable_ parts of remaining tasks, and get them as close as possible to releasable that you have the power to do every single day. Be the change you want to see.

## But... everything that's valuable will take more than a day

- 🔄 If you really can't deliver value, get feedback

If you _really_ can't extract a small enough amount of work, look to the _why_ above - is there anything that can give you feedback, a better understanding of value, or set you up for delivering value daily later on that you _can_ get done today?

It happens, but do whatever you can to make it so this is rare.
